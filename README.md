# SQL Assignment

In this project, I worked with a hospital dataset to extract meaningful insights using SQL queries. 
Some of the key analyses included identifying the top departments with the highest patient count, calculating daily average medical expenses, and determining the hospital with the longest patient stay
This assignment helped me strengthen my practical SQL skills—especially in areas like data aggregation, grouping, filtering, and date functions—and improved my ability to draw actionable insights from raw data.
